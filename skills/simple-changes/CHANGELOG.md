# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-03

- Write-capable integration runs now hold one exclusive active-loop lease and
  keep local mutations, including asynchronous operations, guarded from
  preflight through post-verification. New authoring agents receive isolated,
  branch-bound worktrees through `prepare-agent`, with interrupted setup
  resuming only from the pinned clean state. Worktree approvals track actual
  staged, unstaged, and untracked content, while dead locks can be recovered
  only after every recorded guarded process is proven inactive.

- Added a guarded Sync mode for requests to update from the canonical remote
  target. It refreshes only the resolved target, safely updates clean local
  branches when possible, preserves unsafe checkout state, and never treats
  synchronization as permission to push, rewrite history, deploy, or change
  remote data.
- Authorized Ship runs now begin with a concise scope and delivery-path brief
  while work proceeds, then finish with exact delivery receipts, review-driven
  changes, re-verification, and preserved or blocked work.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-28

- Onboarding can now add or update a managed Simple Changes pointer in an exact
  existing agent instruction file and save whether completed, verified work
  should wait for confirmation, hand off automatically, or wait for an explicit
  user signal. The new `initialize --mode handoff` workflow reports the
  readiness gate and resolved review, integration, ship, or preview boundary;
  `--ready` records confirmation when required.
- Tasks that preserve multiple UI iterations can now save a fallback artifact
  naming preference with `--ui-artifacts` and `--ui-versioning`. Repository
  conventions remain authoritative, and the preference never controls source,
  Git, deployment, package, or release versions.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-27

- Web production deployments now require a complete product release: Simple
  Changes reconciles target-contained pending work into a dated, versioned
  release, deploys only the refreshed reconciled target, and reports the product
  version.

- Skill publishing now distinguishes preserved baseline state from active
  external work. Dirty or unrelated original checkouts and pre-existing
  worktrees, commits, or proposals stay untouched but do not block publication
  through an isolated remote-default worktree. Only activity observed after
  the baseline or a live claim on the exact target is treated as externally
  owned active work, and finished reports separately list published results,
  preserved baseline information, and genuinely outstanding targets.

- Skill publishing now preserves branches, worktrees, and merge or pull
  requests owned by another active agent, task, or person. Broad requests to
  ship, integrate, or prune do not transfer ownership: mutation requires an
  exact explicit handoff, ownership is rechecked immediately beforehand, and
  protected work is reported with the authority still needed.
- Consumer discovery now treats compatibility paths that resolve to one
  physical skill package as a single installation while continuing to flag
  distinct copies for reconciliation.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-27

- Onboarding now explains the consequence of every available option before a
  user chooses how far to take work, handle production and changelogs, request
  help, or save preferences.
- Ship and resumed Ship runs now refresh the canonical remote target after all
  merges and refuse to report completion when the live deployment revision
  differs from that target.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-25

- Skill publishing:
  - The generic `publish-skill` workflow now carries canonical updates through
    maintained forks and every discovered exact-source local consumer.
  - Consumer installs are validated independently while maintained installs and
    intentional pins retain their declared behavior.
- Changelog coordination:
  - Simple Changes now asks how changelogs should be handled only when a
    changelog surface or compatible workflow is available.
  - Delegated changelog changes are accepted only when a source- and
    digest-bound receipt proves the current files and their release impact.
- Queue mode now accounts for every stable unit discovered at the start of a
  run and reports each deferred branch or worktree with its current state,
  reason, and next action.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-23

- Production deployment verification now checks the complete configured set of
  canonical endpoints against the immutable deployment, rather than accepting a
  Ready artifact or one correct hostname.
- Stale provider-managed routing now follows a bounded recovery sequence that
  promotes the existing verified artifact, refreshes every endpoint, and
  reconciles only proven same-project targets without creating duplicate
  deployments or treating DNS changes as ordinary deploys.
- Multi-surface changes now carry explicit parity dispositions for related
  clients, roles, locales, and interfaces while preserving platform-native
  behavior and separate release authority.
- Requests to audit every change proposal now require complete pagination across
  relevant provider states.

- Added the portable Simple Changes skill and CLI for turning repository state
  into focused, verified change proposals while preserving paused and
  concurrent work.
- Added read-only `inventory` and `preview` commands that resolve the canonical
  primary checkout, inspect worktrees, branches, stashes, local changes, policy,
  and available delivery capabilities, then account for every changed path.
- Repeated snapshots distinguish stable work from work that appears or changes
  during a run, so active work remains preserved instead of being swept into a
  proposal.
- Added a strictly read-only `release-notes` command for displaying the latest
  Simple Changes release or a selected version in text or JSON.
- Release-note display defaults to the packaged Simple Changes changelog
  regardless of the current working directory, and an explicit `--repo` can
  inspect another checkout without changing it.
- Public release-note output omits pending `Unreleased` content, private HTML
  comments, and developer-only history.
- Maintainer consistency checking requires
  `release-notes --check --repo PATH`, making repository inspection an explicit
  choice while catching mismatched public, developer, and package releases.
- The installed skill contains no changelog-writing guidance, release behavior
  harness, or model adapters. It reports release impact for handoff but does not
  create or edit release history.
- Simple Changes can be installed alongside `simple-changelogs` without
  overlapping responsibilities: Simple Changes integrates ready work and
  displays its packaged notes, while `simple-changelogs` owns changelog
  authoring.
- Added portable Skills-directory installation and auditable guidance for
  repository-specific Simple Changes forks.
- Added provider-neutral guidance for safely classifying database and
  data-system changes, including migrations, schemas, queries, backfills,
  indexes, and projections, without granting remote-write authority.
- Added schema validation, multiline Markdown verification, human-readable and
  JSON reports, and stable exit codes.
- This initial credential-free release does not create commits, push branches,
  open or merge change proposals, deploy, apply migrations, or clean up Git
  state.
