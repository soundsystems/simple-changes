# Developer changelog

## Unreleased

- Replaced the `publish-simple-changes-forks` package with the repository-local
  `publish-skill` workflow and updated its installation and invocation
  documentation.
- Made consumer discovery, Skills CLI installation, complete package-tree
  verification, temporary-install cleanup, lock or manifest integration,
  consumer proposal integration, and remote default-branch proof mandatory in
  every complete production run.

- Expanded normalized deployment receipts with provider readiness and an
  explicit expected canonical-target inventory. Verification now detects
  missing, unexpected, duplicated, and stale target observations instead of
  trusting the deployment's attached-alias list as the expected set.
- Added a provider-neutral, bounded deployment reconciliation decision contract
  for existing-artifact promotion and same-project managed-target repair.
  Production authority, immutable revision, Ready state, target ownership, and
  single-attempt bounds are enforced before either action; DNS transfers and
  wildcard changes remain separate high-risk operations.
- Added planned operations for promotion and managed-target reconciliation,
  closed-schema support for the new receipt fields, adapter regressions, and
  behavior journeys covering incomplete target coverage, stale-routing
  recovery, missing authority, and missing ownership proof.
- Added portable surface-parity guidance, complete-corpus proposal pagination,
  current-request pause re-evaluation, policy-aware non-author merge execution,
  and evidence-rich preserved/blocked handoffs based on downstream fork gaps.

- Established the portable package architecture: `SKILL.md` routes agent
  behavior, focused references own detailed workflows, and Bun/TypeScript
  enforces deterministic inventory, planning, and validation contracts.
- Added argument-array Git inspection, canonical checkout resolution, repeated
  snapshot digests, repository path-containment checks, symlink detection,
  secret redaction, and plan-conservation validation.
- Added closed JSON Schema contracts for policy, inventory, change plans, run
  state, provider receipts, release consistency, public release notes, runner
  requests and responses, and evaluation manifests.
- Added provider-neutral receipt normalization, approval-revision checks,
  deployment-evidence verification, fake forge adapters, and fixtures without
  implementing authenticated provider mutations.
- Added provider-agnostic data-change guidance covering paired or generated
  histories, compatibility windows, immutable applied revisions, dry runs,
  backfill safety, and post-apply verification.
- Added deterministic path classification for migration histories, schema
  definitions, queries or routines, backfills or seeds, and indexes or
  projections, including data-context checks that avoid treating unrelated
  query-language examples as database changes.
- Added unit and CLI coverage plus trigger and behavior evaluations for the
  credential-free preview boundary, including its zero-mutation and stateless
  guarantees.
- Extended unit tests and behavior journeys for data-path classification,
  generated ORM migrations, non-relational index changes, bounded backfills,
  and remote-write authority boundaries.
- Moved the Simple Changelogs-derived release-writing module into the
  repository-only `tooling/simple-changes/release-notes/` maintainer boundary.
  It is plain linked guidance rather than a discoverable second `SKILL.md` and
  is excluded from the public skill.
- Adopted `.simple-changelogs.json` guidance v4 for maintainer changelog policy,
  including required developer history, existing-only release-note surfaces,
  audit disposition, and canonical `simple-changelogs-signature`
  agent/timestamp comments. `.simple-changes.json` remains scoped to public
  change-integration behavior.
- Maintainer guidance covers first-use setup, historical backfill authority,
  honest pending and released boundaries, merge reconciliation, stable-major
  and prerelease synthesis, and the distinction between complete changelogs and
  compact announcements.
- Added deterministic `CHANGELOG.md` extraction for the latest or selected
  released section, with pending-section exclusion, HTML-comment stripping,
  Markdown and structured JSON output, and explicit errors for missing or empty
  releases.
- Made installed `release-notes` rendering resolve the packaged root changelog
  by default instead of the caller's current directory. Explicit `--repo`
  remains a read-only inspection override, and `--check` rejects calls that do
  not provide it.
- Added a closed consistency-report contract for mismatched public, developer,
  and package versions or dates, malformed or missing sources, and empty pending
  sections.
- Kept release evaluation schemas, five fixtures, the neutral behavior harness,
  deterministic evals, and both Simple Changes and Simple Changelogs fork-drift
  checks under `tooling/simple-changes/` as development-only assets.
- Added Codex CLI, Claude Code, Hermes Agent, Cursor Agent, and Grok Build
  behavior adapters with shared permission-locked guidance snapshots and
  runtime-specific isolation. Grok uses a strict sandbox with memory,
  subagents, plan mode, and web search disabled; the existing adapters retain
  their ephemeral, sandboxed, or disposable repository boundaries.
- Kept authenticated, quota-consuming behavior runs outside the default check
  while covering adapter command construction, schema handling, isolation,
  cleanup, and assertion enforcement with credential-free tests.
- Added package-shape evaluation that rejects maintainer-only release guidance,
  fixtures, tests, behavior tooling, and adapters from the installed skill and
  verifies that maintainer tooling contains no discoverable `SKILL.md`.
- Reduced the public `skills/simple-changes` tree from roughly 560 KB to
  268 KB by moving repository-only assets into maintainer tooling while keeping
  the installed CLI, contracts, and operational references self-contained.
- Adopted Apache-2.0 and standardized development checks on Bun, TypeScript,
  Biome, and Ultracite.
